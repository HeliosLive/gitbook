## Why are we using angular for our projects?

Yes, after a few months we finally found the answer. Sadly, Mike is on vacations right now so I'm afraid we are not able to provide the answer at this point.

## Installing

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ npm i @angular-cli -g
```

 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
